# *DataBase Management System(DBSM)*

### *What is Database Management Software (DBMS)?*

- A Database Management Software or DBM software is used for storing, manipulating, and managing data, such as format, names of fields, and record and file structures in a database environment.

### *What is the PostgreSQL?*

- PostgreSQL is an advanced, enterprise-class, and open-source relational database system. PostgreSQL supports both SQL (relational) and JSON (non-relational) querying.PostgreSQL is a highly stable database backed by more than 20 years of development by the open-source community.

### *Why we need a DataBase Management System (DBMS) instead of a spreadsheet?*

**1. Data Purpose**

*What kind of data is collected is important. Spreadsheets are great for relatively low volumes of numeric and text values. Databases also expertly manage numeric and text values, in addition, they can easily include other types of information such as images and documents.*

**2. Data Volume**

*How much data is collected is also important. Because databases store information more efficiently, databases can process large amounts of information that cannot be managed in a spreadsheet. Spreadsheets have record limitations, while databases do not.*

**3. Editing**

*Updates to databases are typically easier than spreadsheets if they are kept in multiple records or multiple spreadsheets.*
*If data is stored in a set of spreadsheets and regulatory standards are listed on each page, a change to regulatory standards requires changes to be made to all spreadsheets. Whereas, a database can update records in bulk.*

**4. Data Accessibility and Speed**

*Databases provide a flexibility to sort and present data in a myriad of ways that would be nearly impossible to do with two-dimensional spreadsheets. Many databases also provide means to automate query and report generation.*
*Data in separate spreadsheets cannot be easily compared and analyzed. Decisions based on these disparate sets of information can be flawed. When data are maintained in a centralized relational database, data is easily accessible for querying, analysis, and reporting.*

**5. Data Integrity**

*Data integrity is a key difference between databases and spreadsheets. Relational databases follow standardized integrity rules to ensure that the data they contain are accurate and accessible. Database fields can be restricted to specific data types, formats, and/or length.*

**6. Redundancy**

*The database structure also avoids data redundancy. Since the data in different database tables are linked, there is little or no duplication of source data. Frequently data in spreadsheets are copied multiple times and the same data are maintained in separate spreadsheet files, creating a nightmare to ensure accurate data when a change is required.*

**7. Error Proliferation**

*Preventing and efficiently identifying data errors in spreadsheets is challenging.It is also much easier to accidentally overwrite or delete data in a spreadsheet than in a database.*

**8.User Access and Security**

*Unlike spreadsheets, modern relational databases are designed for multiple users. For circumstances that require many users to share information, add new data, and/or make changes to data, a spreadsheet is a bad choice. Databases are ideal for sharing and collaboration of information.*

**__Similarities between Databases and Spreadsheets__**

- The only similarity between these two notions is that both spreadsheets and databases can store data in a tabular format. Numeric and textual values are arranged across columns/fields and rows/records. 

- A spreadsheet is a table or a collection of tables, so is the database. However, databases can store a huge number of tables compared to spreadsheets.


### *Database vs. Spreadsheets Comparison*

| Database | Questions | Spreadsheet |
| ------------ |------------ | ------------ |
| System that stores data arranged in tables | What it is |	File that contains tabular data |
| Storage of large volumes of data	| What is it for? |	Different data manipulations such as reporting, analysis, etc.|
| Requires technological expertise |	Learning curve |	User friendly |
| Limited by the number of files with tabular data |	How much can it store? |	Limited by the number of cells |
| Advanced querying and filtering options thanks to SQL |	Query |	Limited querying and filtering options |
| Data is stored and output in tabular format |	Formatting | Multiple formatting and data visualization features |
| Pretty expensive to set up and maintain |	Budget | Free or low-budget solution |
| Organizations, departments, companies, and other entities with huge volumes of data	| Target user |	Accountants, marketers, teachers, small business owners, and many other categories of users |

### *The benefits of Using Database Management System?*

**As record counts and data quantity increases, so does the need for a database system to effectively manage this quantity of information.**

+ Proper database management systems help increase organizational accessibility to data, which in turn helps the end users share the data quickly and effectively across the organization.

+ A management system helps get quick solutions to database queries, thus making data access faster and more accurate.

+ Implementing a data management system promotes an integrated picture of an organizationâ€™s operations.

+ Data management systems empower the end users to make quick and informed decisions that can contribute to the success or failure of an organization in the long run.

+ A database management system helps in providing a framework to facilitate data quality initiatives. In turn, higher quality information helps in making better, faster decisions in an organization.
